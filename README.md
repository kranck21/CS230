The Gaming Room client is a gaming system that runs off of Android and wanted to advance to running off of more apps. The game was loosely based off the popluar 1980's game, Win, Lose or Draw. In particular, I think I did well in understanding the client's needs, and creating an easy to follow break down of the chanhges that would benefit the game. When developing the code, I found that the list that were provdied helped to break down the code in simpler terms. I think there is always room for improvement but implementing the code would be the area I would need to revisit and revise. I would improve it by trial and error, also with more industry practicing. I did interpret the user's needs and implement them into the software design. Asking myself, is this what the user wants, does this work within their system well or does it need tweaking was alwys on the top of my mind. It is always imperative to consider the user's needs when designing as they are the ones with the budget and customers to win or lose. If the needs are ignored, we are potentially losing them customers and in the long run money. My approach to designing the software was to calulate the storage needed and to do continual testing as the system was being designed rather than waiting until the end to test. Creating a psuedocode was imperative to success. I would also make sure to reach out to other teams members to review the completed code and ask for their feedback.
